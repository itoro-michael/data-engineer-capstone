# data-engineer-capstone
In this project a data model is created from four public datasets, namely: 
the I94 Immigration Data, World Temperature Data, U.S. City Demographic Data, and the
Airport Code Table. A data pipeline is created with Pandas to generate a star schema
from the provided datasets. The datasets are cleaned and filtered for US data, and are
subsequently saved to filesystem in parquet format. These fulfill the capstone project 
requirement of the data engineer nanodegree.
